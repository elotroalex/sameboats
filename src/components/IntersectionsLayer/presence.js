/**
 * Presence is essentially a 3D array:
 * - Authors
 * - Months
 * - Places
 *
 * Or, in other words, presence is a data structure that
 * will allow you to query the likelihood that a given
 * author was present at a given place, in a given month.
 *
 * It also provides a function to query overlaps, i.e.
 * for each place the months where more than one author
 * was likely in a specific place.
 *
 * Internally, the datastructure is an object of the
 * following shape:
 *
 * {
 *   place: 'http://example.com/place/1234': {
 *     '2022-10': [{ author, likelihood }]
 *   }

/**
 * Time interval inference for waypoints, according to the meeting with Alex Gil
 * on Nov 3 2022. Modified (by Rainer Simon) from the initial version at
 * https://github.com/elotroalex/itsb/blob/5be23bf8abd459cbd0cf414687b108b56beaaea0/python/GenerateJson.py#L380-L430
 *
 * ---
 * Score of 3
 * If we have both a start date and an end date for a given location, then the author was very
 * likely in that place from that start date through that end date, so she appears in that location
 * throughout that date range with a likelihood score of 3.
 *
 * If we only have a start date (or an end date) for a given place, then we look at the next
 * (or previous) waypoint of the itinerary to help figure out the likely time range. The time
 * range is assigned a likelihood score of 2 or 1, as follows:
 *
 * Score of 2
 * If we have a START DATE (arrival or earliest presence) at the current waypoint, and the author
 * has a known ARRIVAL DATE at the next location, she was likely at the current waypoint between
 * START DATE and next ARRIVAL DATE. We assign this date range a likelihood of 2.
 *
 * Likewise, if we have an END DATE (departure or lastest presence) at the current waypoint, and
 * the author has a known DEPARTURE DATE at the previous location, we assign the date range (DEPARTURE DATE,
 * END DATE) a likelihood of 2.
 *
 * Score of 1
 * If we have a known START DATE (arrival or earliest) at the current waypoint, and a known
 * EARLIEST date at the next waypoint (but no ARRIVAL DATE!), she may have been at the current
 * waypoint between START DATE and EARLIEST next date. We assign this likelihood a score of 1.
 *
 * Likewise, if we have a known END DATE at the current waypoint (latest or departure), and a
 * known LATEST date at the previous waypoint, we assign the interval (LATEST previous, END DATE)
 * a likelihood of 1.

 * The return type of the method is an object of the following shape:
 *
 * {
 *   'waypoint': ... // the waypoint (for convenience)
 *   'start': ... // Start (type = Date)
 *   'end': ... // End (type = Date)
 *   'likelihood': ... // The inferred likelihood (type = number, value = 1, 2 or 3)
 * }
 *
 * @param {*} waypoint the Waypoint
 * @param {*} graph the ITSBGraph
 * @returns {*} the estimated interval

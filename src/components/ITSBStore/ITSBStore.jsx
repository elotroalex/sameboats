 * @typedef {object} ITSBStoreProps
 * @property {ReactElement} children child components
 * 
 * The Store is a Peripleo-specific abstraction. It represents
 * the domain model of the application - in our case, a graph of
 * Authors, Places and Waypoints.
 *
 * To separate concerns, we split the Store into two sub-components:
 * the ITSBGraphProvider and the ITSBSearchHandler.
 *
 * - The ITSBGraphProvider holds our domain model, and provides basic
 *   query and retrieval functions.
 *
 * - The ITSBSearchHandler 'translates' between our domain model (which
 *   is completely specific to ITSB) and the Peripleo search interface
 *   (which has a predefined, generic structure).
 * @param {ITSBStoreProps} props the component props
 * @returns {ReactElement} the React element

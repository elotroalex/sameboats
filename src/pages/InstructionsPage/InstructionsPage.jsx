      <p>
        This visualization presents an interactive narrative overview of one or more individuals’
        movements through space over time. The date range filter allows for the researcher to
        consider specific periods or phases. You can select figures individually or you can compare
        them to others by selecting them.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a range of time by clicking on the date range in the left column.</li>
        <li>Select one or more authors from the list in the left column.</li>
        <li>
          Once the map has been drawn, you can hover over any dot on the map to read a pop-up note
          about that particular moment in time for that particular author.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Intersections</h2>
      <p>
        This visualization presents an interactive snapshot overview of the world map that reflects
        the presence of Afro-Atlantic figures in particular geographical locations at particular
        points in time. Clicking on a given city reveals which figures were present in that place
        and when they were there. We have worked to preserve a sense of ambiguity when a range of
        time is not certain. This uncertainty is indicated via the transparent aura encircling each
        dot. The size of the aura indicates the level of ambiguity.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a range of time by clicking on the date range in the left column.</li>
        <li>Select one or more authors from the list in the left column.</li>
        <li>
          Select a dot on the map to see what figures were at that spot in the same time range.

        Same Boats is a fundamentally collaborative venture&mdash;an invitation of sorts meant to
        provide our community with the opportunity to participate in the development of a unique
        platform and to imagine research projects and pedagogical initiatives that transgress the
        geo-political borders separating the various nations of the Americas. If you’re interested
        in being a part of this project by proposing an additional figure or in working with one of
        our existing figures/editors, please contact us at{' '}

          particular points in time. Clicking on a given city which figures were present in that
          place and when they were there.

        <strong>In the Same Boats</strong> is a work of multimodal scholarship designed to encourage
        the collaborative production of humanistic knowledge within scholarly communities. The
        platform comprises two interactive visualizations that trace the movements of significant
        cultural actors from the Caribbean and wider Americas, Africa, and Europe within the 20th
        century Afro-Atlantic world. It presents opportunities for unearthing the extent to which
        Caribbean, Latin American, African, European, and Afro-American intellectuals have been in
        both punctual and sustained conversation with one another: attending the same conferences,
        publishing in the same journals and presses, active in the same political groups, perhaps
        even elbow-to-elbow in the same Parisian caf√©s and on the same transatlantic
        crossings&mdash;literally and metaphorically <strong>in the same boats</strong>&mdash;as
        they circulate throughout the Americas, Africa, Europe, and beyond.

        One of the greatest challenges for postcolonial scholars of Africa and its diasporas is that
        of navigating nation-language frontiers that are the legacies of colonialism. The
        partitioning of the postcolonial into anglophone, francophone, hispanophone, and lusophone
        spaces persists&mdash;despite being in so many ways at odds with the shared socio-cultural
        and historical realities of the Afro-Atlantic. Same Boats pushes back against the academic
        balkanization of black Atlantic intellectual production, retracing limits and contours
        largely determined by imperial metropoles.

      <p>
        In presenting a series of individual maps produced on a common template by specialists of
        the different linguistic regions of the western Atlantic, Same Boats seeks to counter the
        Euro-lingual constraints and attendant border-drawing that too often keep Caribbeanist,
        Latin-Americanist, Africanist, Afro-Europeanist, and Afro-Americanist scholars from engaging
        in deeply transnational and transcolonial dialogue, hindering us from seeing connections or
        from fully imagining a networked Afro-intellectual world. Literally mapping the network of
        Afro-diasporic intellectual, political, and aesthetic figures in the 20th century, Same
        Boats offers visual corroboration of the work of scholars who have long committed to
        thinking about the Afro-Atlantic as an integrally networked chronotope. This platform aims
        to facilitate a physical tracing of hemispheric black studies&mdash;to provide a point of
        departure from which to highlight the various sites wherein Afro-Atlantic intellectual
        traditions may have been born and/or shepherded into the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform&apos;s visualizations sketch a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; narrative of Black
        intellectual and artistic migration, revealing what were the potential points and periods of
        encounter (&ldquo;Trajectories&rdquo;). Upon drilling down into the maps&apos;
        spatio-temporal intersections, specific nodes of confluence emerge, calling&mdash;we
        hope&mdash;for further scholarly exploration (&ldquo;Intersections&rdquo;). Indeed, Same
        Boats is meant to serve above all as an invitation for our community of researchers,
        students, and educators to flesh out and enrich the scholarly record toward the constitution
        of a 20th century Afro-Atlantic Republic of Arts and Letters.
